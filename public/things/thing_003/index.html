        <h1>Save time with clipboard history</h1>
        <div class="thingIntro">
          <p>Reading this post will take some time, but I guarantee you will win this time back once you start using your clipboard history in your workflow. What is it? Well, as its name suggests, it&#39;s an overview of your clipboard history. It displays everything you&#39;ve copied recently; Text, images, videos, pdfs, etc. All at your fingertips and ready to be pasted!</p>
        </div>
        <h3>Why do I need this?</h3>
<p>Well, to speed up your workflow! If you copy and paste, clipboard history will be a huge timesaver. Let me explain why you need this with a few examples.</p>
<h4>Easy to recall</h4>
<p>It's easy to recall what you copied yesterday, but finding the item or retyping the exact phrase can be challenging or even impossible. You can go through your recent files or browser history, but it does take some time. Searching again is no longer needed if you have set up a clipboard history. You can scroll through your latest copied items and paste.</p>
<h4>Pasted the wrong thing</h4>
<p>It happens that you paste something, but it's not what you had in mind. You already copied something else, but you've forgotten about it. With a clipboard history, you can quickly get your second last copy.</p>
<h4>No need to jump around</h4>
<p>You can copy multiple items before going to your paste destination, and this can speed up your workflow because there is less need to click around. You can also see it as short-term storage for things you might need later.</p>
<h3>Getting started</h3>
<p>Let's start with the setup for Windows users. The lucky ones, because Windows 10 and higher comes with a clipboard history feature preinstalled! Windows logo key + V does the trick. If this does not work, enable clipboard history in your settings.
For Mac users, it's a bit more work because it's is not preinstalled on Monterey (The latest OS when writing this). Luckily, great third-party tools exist to set up a clipboard history—Raycast.com, Alfredapp.com, Pasteapp.io, and probably more. Find your favorite and get started! I'll explain how you set it up with Raycast.</p>
<ol>
<li><a href="https://www.raycast.com/">Download Raycast</a>. on your Mac</li>
<li>Start Raycast and go Settings (⌘,)</li>
<li>Search for 'Clipboard History'</li>
<li>Make sure the Clipboard History is Enabled ✔</li>
<li>Setup a Hotkey (shortcut)</li>
<li>Done</li>
</ol>
<h4>Choosing a Shortcut</h4>
<p>A shortcut triggers the clipboard history view. If you are not really into shortcuts, I recommend choosing an easy one. It's a shame to forget the combination and end up not using the feature at all. <img src="/images/keyboard.png"><figcaption>The Shortcut I'm using for clipboard history</figcaption><br><br></p>
<p>Make sure your chosen shortcut is unique and does not overwrite your OS shortcuts. So ⌘V (Used my clipboard history to paste the ⌘ ) is a bad idea; you don't want to trigger the clipboard history every time you paste.</p>
<p>I hope this post inspires you to set up a clipboard history tool. It will boost your efficiency and save you a few hours per year.</p>
