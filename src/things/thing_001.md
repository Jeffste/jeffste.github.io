title: Hand drawn vectors
short: Quick hand-drawn vectors for the Figma Community

Hand-drawn vectors you can use to spice up presentations or any other artwork. Not so special, but it feels good to do something for the community. With duplicates, likes, and comments in the Figma community, I assume a few creatives find this useful for their project.
