### What let you in design
Growing up, I was fascinated by video and computer games. So I decided to become a Game Developer by enrolling in a Computer Engineering degree.

By the second year of college, I got too bored with what they were teaching me in the class. I wanted to explore what was out there; I wanted to learn the technologies used in real-world products. So, I started making websites.

And slowly but surely, I figured that I was more interested in designing a website than coding it. So, I decided to make a full-time career in design.

Fortunately, after graduation, I landed a job at BookMyShow â€“ the largest ticketing portal for entertainment in India. They hired me as a developer who could design, and my professional journey as a designer began from there.
