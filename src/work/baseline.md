title: Baseline

workIntro: A concept I created during my graduation internship at Yummygum. The idea originates from an issue I had during my professional career as an amateur tennis player. The problem to solve was; League tennis matches require too much paperwork afterward and it takes too long. As a tennis player, I faced all this paperwork every week, every week with disbelief that there wasn't a digital solution.
